# Documentation for Django Application: Personal Trust

## Overview

The Personal Trust application is designed to manage client information, addresses, and relationships. This application was developed focusing on user authentication, client management, and relationship handling. The project includes a robust backend with Django and a responsive frontend using Bootstrap. Unit and functional tests have been written for each implemented user story to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Achievements

### Authentication
1. **User Login**:
   - Implemented a login page with a custom design for user authentication.
   - Navbar shows login status (e.g., "Logged in as Joe Soap" for authenticated users).
   - Login button is visible only to non-authenticated users.
   - Functional tests ensure non-authenticated users can log in and authenticated users can see their status.

2. **User Logout (Bonus)**:
   - Implemented a logout functionality.
   - Logout button is visible only to authenticated users.
   - Functional tests ensure authenticated users can log out successfully.

### Clients
1. **Access Control**:
   - Non-authenticated users cannot access the client list.
   - Navbar hides the client list button for non-authenticated users.
   - Functional tests ensure proper access control and visibility based on authentication status.

2. **Client List Pagination**:
   - Client list is paginated to show only 20 clients per page.
   - Pagination controls allow navigation to the first, last, previous, and next pages.
   - Functional tests ensure the pagination works correctly and displays the appropriate number of clients per page.

3. **Client Search**:
   - Basic search bar above the client list allows filtering by name, surname, or ID number.
   - (Real-time search is currently under development)
   - Functional tests ensure the search functionality works correctly and updates the client list as expected.

4. **Client Creation**:
   - Client creation form allows adding new clients with their details and addresses.
   - Validates South African ID numbers using the Luhn algorithm.
   - Ensures uniqueness of ID numbers in the database.
   - Functional tests ensure the client creation form validates inputs correctly and handles duplicate ID numbers appropriately.

### Address Management
- **Address Form**:
  - Fields for street, city, province, postal code, country, and address type.
  - Linked with the client creation form to capture address information during client registration.
  - Functional tests ensure addresses are correctly associated with clients and validated.

### Frontend Design
- **Home Page**:
  - Redesigned with a modern and engaging layout.

- **Login Page**:
  - Enhanced visual appeal with a creative and user-friendly design.

## Not Achieved (Under Development)
1. **Client Relationship Management**:
   - Logic for creating and managing client relationships is present but currently breaking.
   - Ensuring inverse relationships are created simultaneously.
   - Requires further debugging and testing to ensure stability and correctness.

2. **Real-time Search**:
   - Real-time search functionality for the client list is not currently operational.
   - Requires additional development and testing to ensure smooth real-time updates.

3. **Visual Feedback for Duplicate ID Numbers**:
   - Currently, there is no visual feedback on the client creation form for ensuring the uniqueness of ID numbers.
   - Users need clear error messages and feedback when attempting to input duplicate ID numbers.

### Future Work
1. **Fix Client Relationship Management**:
   - Debug and fix the breaking issues in the client relationship logic.
   - Ensure that inverse relationships are correctly created and managed.

2. **Implement Real-time Search**:
   - Complete the development and integration of real-time search functionality for the client list.

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add comprehensive error messages and user feedback for different scenarios, especially for duplicate ID numbers.

4. **Refactoring**:
   - Refactor existing code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance, ensuring adherence to best practices and design patterns.

### Conclusion
The Personal Trust application has made significant progress in managing client and address information, with a robust user authentication system and a user-friendly frontend design. The applicationâ€™s primary functionalities are in place, but further development and debugging are required to fully achieve all planned features, particularly the client relationship management and comprehensive error handling.
